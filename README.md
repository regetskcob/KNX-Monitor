# KNX Monitor

Bus monitor and diagnostic tool for KNX. Available today as a Home Assistant
add-on and for Linux; the apps for iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac and Windows
follow in the coming weeks. The KNX Box, a Raspberry Pi that records on site,
is a preview, set up with the app, on an IP gateway or directly on the bus with the kBerry module; its image is listed under Downloads.

This repository hosts the Home Assistant add-on repository, the Linux and
KNX Box downloads, and the issue tracker. The source code of KNX Monitor is not
public.

## Your data stays yours

KNX Monitor works on your network and stores on your devices. You need no
account to use it, and it contains no analytics or advertising libraries.
Project, telegrams, recordings and keys stay on your device, your KNX Box or
your Home Assistant, and only leave when you share them.

From version 1.9.1 the apps encrypt their files with AES-256-GCM (key in the
system keychain; unencrypted on Linux without libsecret, and for settings such
as the gateway), offer an optional app lock, and back up everything to a file
with its own password in an [open format](BACKUP-FORMAT.md). The add-on and the
Box do not encrypt their files themselves; they rely on your backups and on
physical access to the host. Details and limits:
