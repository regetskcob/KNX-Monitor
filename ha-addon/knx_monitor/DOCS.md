# KNX Monitor

KNX Monitor as a sidebar panel in Home Assistant: group monitor, objects,
communication map, recordings and bus diagnostics – in the browser, on any
device, also on the go via the Home Assistant app.

## How it works

Browsers cannot speak UDP. The small server in the add-on forwards the app's
KNXnet/IP packets via WebSocket to the gateway (tunneling, NAT mode) and stores
the ETS catalog, recordings and long-term history in the add-on's data folder
(included in backups).

- Access only through Home Assistant (Ingress) – requests to the port from
  anywhere else in the LAN are rejected.
- The add-on keeps **one** connection to the bus, shared by all open views
  (tunnel, routing, IP Secure or the Home Assistant KNX integration). While
  the bus monitor tool is open, the add-on hands its tunnel over to it –
  recording pauses for that time and resumes when you close the bus monitor.
- Use **Pause** on the start screen to free the tunnel, e.g. for ETS.
- The add-on uses the host network so it can reach the gateway via UDP and
  discover gateways on your network.

## Getting started

1. Start the add-on and open **KNX Monitor** in the sidebar.
2. Pick your gateway (discovered automatically) or enter its IP address.
3. Optionally import your ETS project (`.knxproj` or group address CSV) to get
   names, datapoint types and devices.

Gateway address and language are chosen in the app and remembered per browser.

## Continuous recording

Once you connect in the app, the add-on stays connected – also when no browser
is open – and reconnects by itself after gateway restarts or network dropouts.
Every telegram goes into the history (Recordings → History), one file per day;
finished days are compressed. Retention (days), size limit and write interval
are set in the app. Writing less often spares an SD card, but a power cut then
loses the last block.

Once a minute the add-on notes whether the bus was connected. Gaps in the
history are explained in the day list ("bus disconnected for 3 min",
"add-on not running for 11 h").

The history, settings and an imported keyring are part of Home Assistant
backups.

## Comments, reporting a problem, exports

- **Comments** can be added to telegrams, charts and recordings, with up to
  three screenshots. They are stored per installation in the add-on's data
  folder and listed under Tools › Comments.
- **Report a problem** (Tools): start it, reproduce the fault and tap "It
  happened now" each time, then create the diagnostic package and send it to
  your electrician. Opening a package shows its findings. Names can be left
  out of the package.
- **Exports** collects everything in one page: telegrams as PDF, CSV or ETS
  file, reports, a combined ZIP and the last exports.

## Connection types

- **UDP / TCP tunnel** – TCP copes better with lossy links (KNXnet/IP 2.0).
  Optionally request a fixed tunnel address; if it is taken, a free one is used.
- **Routing** – multicast 224.0.23.12 via an IP router, uses no tunnel slot.
- **IP Secure** – user and password of the secure tunnel (or import the ETS
  keyring, then they are taken from it).
- **Home Assistant** – no own tunnel: reads what the KNX integration of Home
  Assistant receives and sends via `knx.send` / `knx.read`. Device access
  (programming mode, address check, bus monitor) is not available this way.

## KNX Data Secure

Import the keyring exported from ETS (project → export keyring) under
Project → KNX Secure. Secured group telegrams are then decrypted live and in
the recording; writing to secured addresses is encrypted.

## Alarm notifications

When a group address switches to an alarm or fault state, the add-on creates a
Home Assistant notification (at most one per address every 5 minutes; can be
turned off with `alarm_notifications` in the add-on configuration). With
continuous recording this also works without an open browser.

## Watchers

Watchers (Tools → Watchers) report a group address as soon as it is sent,
optionally only for a certain value. In the add-on they run on the server:
they keep working without an open browser and send a Home Assistant
notification (at most one per watcher and minute; also as push if
`notify_service` is set; can be turned off with `watcher_notifications`). An open KNX Monitor additionally plays the sound
and shows the hit. Watchers are stored in the add-on and shared by all
browsers.

## Automations

The add-on fires Home Assistant events you can use as triggers ("Event" in
the automation editor), also without an open browser. They fire whether or
not notifications are on:

| Event | When | Data |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `knx_monitor_watcher` | a watcher fires | `watcher_id`, `name`, `label`, `address`, `source`, `value` (number rules), `raw`, `installation` |
| `knx_monitor_alarm` | an alarm or fault object switches on or off | `address`, `name`, `kind` (`alarm`/`fault`), `active`, `installation` |
| `knx_monitor_bus` | the bus connection is lost or back | `connected`, `state`, `reason`, `installation` |

Blueprints to import with one click:

- [Watcher fired](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fregetskcob%2FKNX-Monitor%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fknx_monitor_watcher.yaml)
- [Alarm or fault](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fregetskcob%2FKNX-Monitor%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fknx_monitor_alarm.yaml)
- [Bus connection lost or back](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fregetskcob%2FKNX-Monitor%2Fblob%2Fmain%2Fblueprints%2Fautomation%2Fknx_monitor_bus.yaml)

Example without a blueprint:

```yaml
triggers:
  - trigger: event
    event_type: knx_monitor_alarm
    event_data:
      active: true
actions:
  - action: notify.mobile_app_my_iphone
    data:
      title: "KNX alarm"
      message: "{{ trigger.event.data.name }} ({{ trigger.event.data.address }})"
```

If you notify yourself through automations, turn off `alarm_notifications`
and `watcher_notifications` below, so you do not get two messages.

## Device and entities (MQTT)

If an MQTT broker is set up in Home Assistant (usually the Mosquitto add-on
with the MQTT integration), the add-on appears as the device **KNX Monitor**
by itself; no credentials to enter. It brings:

| Entity | What |
| --- | --- |
| Bus connected | connectivity of the add-on's bus connection |
| Recording | switch to pause and resume continuous recording |
| Telegrams per minute, Telegrams today | bus activity |
| Repeats per minute, Last telegram | diagnostics |
| Watcher, Alarm | event entities with the same data as the events above |

On the device page under Automations you find **device triggers** for each
watcher and for alarms and faults switching on or off, so you do not need to
type event names. If the add-on stops, the device shows as unavailable.

Without a broker everything else keeps working; the device appears as soon as
one is set up (the add-on checks every 5 minutes).

## Dashboard card

Charts you save in KNX Monitor (Tools → Charts) can go straight onto your
dashboards: add the card **KNX Monitor chart** ("Add card", search for
"KNX"), pick the chart and the time range. The card reads the values from
the continuous recording, so it shows the whole range even for addresses
Home Assistant does not know, and updates every minute. Tap or hover to read
the values at a point in time; 1 h, 6 h, 24 h and 7 days can be switched on
the card itself.

Besides group addresses, charts can show the bus itself: telegrams per
minute, repeats per minute and the load per line. In KNX Monitor they are
in the chart library under "Bus"; on the card the add-on computes them from
the continuous recording.

The add-on puts the card into `/config/www/knx-monitor/` and registers it as
a dashboard resource on every start; nothing to install. If `www` did not
exist before, Home Assistant needs one restart (a notification says so).
Dashboards in YAML mode have no resource list; add it there yourself:

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/knx-monitor/knx-monitor-chart-card.js
      type: module
```

```yaml
type: custom:knx-monitor-chart-card
chart: Living room
hours: 24
title: Climate # optional
```

## Installation report

Tools › Installation report. Off by default. Once enabled, the add-on condenses every
day and creates a monthly or quarterly report: availability, traffic, bus load, repeats,
devices that went silent, smoke detectors and batteries, compared with the previous
report. In the app it is available as a PDF.

Notifications are off by default too. You can choose ntfy, a webhook or Home Assistant
as the destination; only a summary line is sent, never addresses, names or values. This
is not an alarm system: urgent findings are checked once a day.

## Data export

Tools › Data export, off by default, for your own Grafana:

- **Prometheus:** a separate port (default 9464) serves `/metrics`, only to the local
  network and only with the bearer token the app shows once. The add-on uses the host
  network, so the port needs no further setting.
- **InfluxDB 1 or 2:** the add-on sends to the address you enter.
- Without "Include addresses, names and values" only bus counters are exported.
- The Grafana templates for both can be saved from the same page.

## Without an own tunnel

If Home Assistant already has the KNX integration set up, the add-on suggests
sharing its connection: connection mode "Home Assistant" instead of an own
tunnel slot on the gateway (see Connection types).

## Configuration

```yaml
alarm_notifications: true
watcher_notifications: true
notify_service: notify.mobile_app_my_iphone
dashboard_card: true
```

- `alarm_notifications`: Home Assistant notification when an alarm or fault
  object triggers (default on).
- `watcher_notifications`: Home Assistant notification when a watcher fires
  (default on).

- `notify_service` (optional): additionally send a push notification via a
  notify service, e.g. `notify.mobile_app_my_iphone`. Leave empty for a
  Home Assistant notification only.
- `dashboard_card`: install and register the dashboard card (default on,
  see Dashboard card). Turn off if you do not use it.

## Updates and going back

Home Assistant offers a backup before each add-on update – keep it switched on.
If a new version misbehaves, restore that backup (Settings → System → Backups):
it brings back the previous version together with its data. Recordings and
settings live in the add-on's data folder and survive normal updates.

The **Watchdog** switch on the add-on's Info page is off by default. Turned on, Home
Assistant restarts the add-on when its server stops responding. A missing gateway does
not count: the bus reconnects by itself.
